# kotlin-boilerplate
Simple Kotlin hello world, and compile script that uses the command-line compiler. Run ./compile.sh in bash to compile and run your kotlin files in ./src/ on the JVM. Useful for when you don't want to use IntelliJ IDEA. Requires that you have the kotlin compiler and runtime installed and on the PATH. Compiled app.jar will be in ./dist/, and it assumes that the main function will be in app.kt
